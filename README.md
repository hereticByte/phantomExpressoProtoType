# phantomExpressoProtoType

This Code is meant to be the prototype for a planned debugger for the programming language HAXE. It is published for presentational purposes only. 

Please read the wiki for more deatails:

---------------------------------------------

To work with the prototype:
  With an open source account github seems to me a little bit tricky. I will later on create a regular account, 
  so you will find any comfort in this repository as you are used to. But for the time beeing, I hope, you
  don't mind having this work-around.


Download and unpack the library
  _phantomExpressionist.zip_	

Copy the unpacked folder into your local folder _haxeTools/haxe/lib/_  

Download and unpack the prototype experimental code
	_phantomExpressionistDevelopmentProj.zip_
	
This is your haxe project you can compile to see how the library prototype works. Of cause, you can 
use any other software code you want to be identified. For that purpuse you can copy and modify
the _cpp.hxml_ file to make if fit your needs. I have commented it, so you know what it is good for.

Have fun!

Kind regards
Arnim
