# phantomExpressoProtoType

This Code is meant to be the prototype for a planned debugger for the programming language HAXE. It is published for presentational purposes only. 

Please read the wiki for more deatails:

---------------------------------------------

To work with the prototype:
  With an open source account github seems to me a little bit tricky. I will later on create a regular account, 
  so you will find any comfort in this repository as you are used to. But for the time beeing, I hope, you
  don't mind having this work-around.


Download and unpack the library
  _phantomExpressionist.zip_	

Copy the unpacked folder into your haxeTools/haxe/lib/  

Download and unpack the prototype experimental code
	phantomExpressionistDevelopmentProj.zip
	
This is your haxe project you can compile to see how the library prototype works.
